# Wordless
Clone of Wordle, for my girls to play, with a choice of word length and number of guesses, and no limit on games per day/session.

## Things to add/fix

 * Congratulate the player when they win ("Genius!", "TODO", "TODO", "TODO", "TODO", "Phew!")
 * Add a virtual keyboard, with colouring for found & ruled out letters
 * Deny the entry of guesses that aren't in the dictionary
 * Proper screen for settings including choice of word length and dictionary to use (currently using an MIT word list)
    * or maybe make a New Game screen where you get to set these things?
 * Acknowledge the MIT word list (is it released under some license?)
 * Crop the Lexipedia word list in resources rather than doing it programmatically
 * Offer a setting of max number of guesses
 * Remember settings across sessions
 * Proper home screen
 * Nicer styling for buttons, text entry, etc.
 * Proper navigation behind the scenes (look up the WPF navigation classes and try them out)
 * Play around with a port to UWP?
 * Make an icon?
 * Animate various things


## Not needed for the girls

 * Hard mode
 * High-contrast mode
 * Dark mode
